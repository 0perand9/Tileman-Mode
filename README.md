# Tileman Mode Custom Plugin 
Tileman Mode is a series on youtube, see it here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNTajexsGYaw5pcyLOMyrW6w8_IMDG90

The game mode is defined by the player being limited to standing on certain tiles. The amount of tiles you are allowed to stand on depends on your total experience. Each 1000 exp represents one tile you can 'spend'. 

This plugin sets out to make the marking of tiles and the counting of both your used and remaining tiles automated.

## Features
Automatically fills in tiles as you walk/run.

Ability for the tiles/overlay change colour to notify you when you've gone over your set tile limit (defaults to 50) or when you use up all your tiles.

Option to include your total level in the total available tiles, along side your exp tiles. 

## Known Issues
When running, occasionally some tiles may not be automatically filled in for you. This happens when your character moves in an 'L' shape.

Lagging will cause some tiles to be missed
