# Tileman Mode Custom Plugin 
Tileman Mode is a series on youtube, check out the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNTajexsGYaw5pcyLOMyrW6w8_IMDG90">here</a>.

The game mode is defined by the player being limited to standing on certain tiles. The amount of tiles you are allowed to stand on depends on your total experience. Each 1000 exp represents one tile you can 'spend'. 

This plugin sets out to make the marking of tiles and the counting of both your used and remaining tiles automated.

## Installing 

###Method 1 (doesnt allow other external plugins)
To install and play Tileman Mode on RuneLite, go to releases and download the latest release.

Unzip, then run the jar file to launch (You must have JRE installed).


###Method 2
Alternatively, use the method <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eTTrlFoKPc&">described in this video</a>.

Once you find RuneLite's plugin folder, put all the files from this repos src/main/java/com/tileman/ folder into their own 'tileman' folder inside the plugins folder.

Once installed and have RuneLite launched, you <b>should disable</b> the 'Ground Markers' plugin. If you don't there will be some visual bugs (tiles will be rendered twice).

## Features
Automatically fill in tiles as you walk/run with 'Auto-mark'.

Draw tiles on the minimap.

Ability for the tiles/overlay change colour to notify you when you've gone over your set tile limit or when you use up all your tiles.

Choose from a selection of gamemodes, each with different rules and difficulties.

Option to add additional tiles to your total usable tiles.

Option to include your total level in the total usable tiles, along side your exp tiles. 

## Known Issues
When running, occasionally some tiles may not be automatically filled in for you. This happens when your character moves in an 'L' shape.

Lagging will cause some tiles to be missed
